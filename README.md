# RRproject

### About the Project

Within the Reproducible Research course, we completed a project, which uses 3 machine learning approaches to construct a credit scoring model and determine which model provides better prediction for credit scores. 
For transparency, we detailed every steps we taken for data preprocessing. 
And to identify relevant features to our model, we employed correlation coefficient for numeric variable, and ANOVA analysus for categorical variables to determine which variables have relationship and association to Credit Score.
Lastly we employed Random Forest, Adaboost, Neural Network models. We specified the hyperparameters so that other researchers can replicate our model. Based on the model prediction, Random Forest and Neural Networking model was equally good for credit scoring. Adaboost was least predictive out of the 3 models. 

### Structure of the codes

- You can find coding and explaination of the result from the **"RRproj.qmd"** file. If you prefer it you can also see it from **"RRproj.html"** rendered file.
- Data used in the analysis is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification). You can find it from **"train.csv"** file.

### Dependencies

We run wrote the codes in Visual Studio Code with extentions of Quarto, Python.
