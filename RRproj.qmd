## Introduction

In this project we applied 3 machine learning classification algorithms to build model to predict Credit scores. The dataset we used for this project is Credit scoring dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification).

### Importing Neccessary Libraries

Following libraries are used for this project
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import re
import numpy as np
from sklearn import preprocessing
from sklearn.preprocessing import scale
import os
```

### Dataset

Initial dimension of the data had 100'000 rows and 28 variables. After removing some unique identification variables we are going to work on are:

-   "Month" - Month of the year
-   "Age" - Age of the person, We limited it into 14+56
-   "Occupation" - Occupation of the person, 16 factor
-   "Annual_Income" - Annual income of the person, continuous variable
-   "Monthly_Inhand_Salary" - Monthly salary, continuous variable
-   "Num_Bank_Accounts" - Num of bank accounts the person holds
-   "Num_Credit_Card" - Num of credit card the person holds
-   "Interest_Rate" - Interest rate on credit card
-   "Num_of_Loan" - Num of loans from the bank
-   "Type_of_Loan" - Type of loan
-   "Delay_from_due_date" - Average number of days delayed from the payment date
-   "Num_of_Delayed_Payment" - Average number of payments delayed by a person
-   "Changed_Credit_Limit" - Percentage change in credit card limit
-   "Num_Credit_Inquiries" - number of credit card inquiries
-   "Credit_Mix" - Classification of the mix of credits
-   "Outstanding_Debt" - remaining debt to be paid (in USD)
-   "Credit_Utilization_Ratio" - utilization ratio of credit card
-   "Credit_History_Age" - age of credit history of the person
-   "Payment_of_Min_Amount" - whether only the minimum amount was paid by the person
-   "Total_EMI_per_month" - monthly EMI payments (in USD)
-   "Amount_invested_monthly" - monthly amount invested by the customer (in USD)
-   "Payment_Behaviour" - payment behavior of the customer
-   "Monthly_Balance" - monthly balance amount of the customer (in USD)
-   "Credit_Score" - bracket of credit score (Poor, Standard, Good)

Our target variable Credit_Score has 3 classes, but we only took **"Poor"** and **"Good"** categories to further analysis.

```{python}
credit_score=pd.read_csv('train.csv', )
```
```{python}
credit_score.head()
```




### Data Preprocessing

We prepared the data set for further analysis step by removing rows with missing values, transforming character variables into categorical/factor variables, and numeric variables and standardized it and removing outliers.
